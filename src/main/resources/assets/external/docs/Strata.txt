==== Tile Data ===

Information about each tile consists of a contiguous block of non-empty lines
in any file directly under `config/strata/tiledata`. Each line works like a
keyvalue or a key with multiple values. Line order within a block does not
matter unless otherwise noted.

<> values are required. [] values are optional.

--- Keyvalues ---

Key: generate
Value: <name> <TileType>
Description:
	Register a block of type to be generated.
	Drops and recipes are determined using types that share a name.

Key: host
Value: <ResourceLocation> [meta]
Description:
	Register the block as one from which ores may acquire various properties.
	Value is ignored with generate.

Key: type
Value: <TileType>
Description:
	Controls block properties such as preferred harvest tool and interaction sounds.
	Value is redundant with generate.

Key: harvestLevel
Value: <int>
Default: 0
Description:
	Level of tool required for harvest.

Key: hardness
Value: <float>
Default: 0.0
Description:
	Harvest difficulty.

Key: resistance
Value: <float>
Default: 1.7 * hardness if ore, 5.0 * hardness otherwise
Description:
	Explosion resistance.

Key: texture[Caps|Sides|Up|Down|North|South|East|West]
Value: [<ResourceLocation> <BlendMode> <opacity:float>]* <ResourceLocation>
Description:
	Generate a texture for the block model using an optional array of layers blended onto a required base.
	Must come after a required "generate" line.

Key: convertsTo
Value: <ResourceLocation> [meta]
Description:
	One-way, one-to-one conversion to another item for compatibility purposes.

Key: sustains
Value: <<EnumPlantType>|<ResourceLocation> [meta]>+
Description:
    Allows the block to sustain EnumPlantType(s) and/or what is sustained by other block(s).
    Multiple values are allowed. EnumPlantType order does not matter but ResourceLocation order does.
    Only applies to primary types.
    Disclaimer: This will not work for everything due to world caching Strata cannot intercept.

Key: textureResource
Value: <ResourceLocation>
Description:
	Location of an existing texture.

Key: ore
Value: <name> [blockOreDictionaryName] [itemOreDictionaryName]
Description:
	Register an ore to be generated.
	The world block and dropped item may have distinct ore dictionary entries, if specified.
	itemOreDictionaryName defaults to blockOreDictionaryName (which may be unspecified).
	Use a hyphen ("-") to indicate that object should not be registered with the ore dictionary.

Key: proxy
Value: <ResourceLocation> [meta]
Description:
    Drop the drops of the specified block instead.
    Only applies to ores.

Key: burnTime
Value: <int>
Default: 0
Description:
    Ticks the ore will burn for in a furnace.
    For reference, there are 20 ticks per second and it takes 10 seconds to smelt an item. Standard coal is 1600.

Key: drops
Value: <baseDropAmount> [maxBonusDropExpr]
Default: 1
Description:
    Controls the number of items dropped by an ore.
    Will always drop baseDropAmount with a random bonus of zero to the result of maxBonusDropExpr, inclusive.
    maxBonusDropExpr shall be a simple expression in Reverse Polish notation. Operators +, -, *, and / are available.
    The value of fortune is provided as the variable 'f'.
    The result of maxBonusDropExpr is rounded to the nearest integer.
    For example, "drops 0 0.2 f *" will only give a 50% chance of dropping an ore with Fortune III.
    Never drops more than a full stack.

Key: exp
Value: <baseExp> [maxBonusExpExpr]
Default: 1
Description:
    Controls the amount of experience dropped by an ore.
    Will always drop baseExp with a random bonus of zero to the result of maxBonusExpExpr, inclusive.
    maxBonusExpExpr shall be a simple expression in Reverse Polish notation. Operators +, -, *, and / are available.
    The value of fortune is provided as the variable 'f'.
    The result of maxBonusExpExpr is rounded to the nearest integer.
    For example, "exp 0 2 f +" may provide 0-5 experience upon being mined/dug with Fortune III.
