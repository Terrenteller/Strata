## Prologue

Once upon a time, there was a mod named [PerFabricaAdAstra](https://github.com/lawremi/PerFabricaAdAstra) that fell by the wayside. Disappointed with the thought of a revitalized and colourful underground that might never be, I took it upon myself to re-imagine the "Geologica" part of the PFAA triad, leaving Chemica and Fabrica to established tech mods like Mekanism and Immersive Engineering.

As you may have anticipated, the result is Strata!

## What is Strata?

Strata is a Forge-based geological block generation and ore compatibility mod for Minecraft and spiritual successor to PFAA Geologica. It provides a platform for new content through resource packs which contain non-standard plain-text configuration files of minimal complexity. Strata's primary directive is to shape a consistent gameplay experience across the blocks it creates and the blocks it does not create but may represent.
